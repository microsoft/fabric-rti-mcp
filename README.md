## üéØ Overview

A comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [Microsoft Fabric Real-Time Intelligence (RTI)](https://aka.ms/fabricrti). 
This server enables AI agents to interact with Fabric RTI services by providing tools through the MCP interface, allowing for seamless data querying, analysis, and streaming capabilities.

> [!NOTE]  
> This project is in Public Preview and implementation may significantly change prior to General Availability.

### üîç How It Works

The Fabric RTI MCP Server creates a seamless integration between AI agents and Fabric RTI services through:

- üîÑ Smart JSON communication that AI agents understand
- üèóÔ∏è Natural language commands that get translated to KQL operations and Eventstream management
- üí° Intelligent parameter suggestions and auto-completion
- ‚ö° Consistent error handling that makes sense
- üìä Unified interface for both analytics and streaming workloads

### ‚ú® Supported Services

```

## üêõ Debugging the MCP Server locally
Assuming you have python installed and the repo cloned:

### Install locally
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Configure

Add the server to your
```
{
    "mcp": {
        "servers": {
            "local-fabric-rti-mcp": {
                "command": "python",
                "args": [
                    "-m",
                    "fabric_rti_mcp.server"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Attach the debugger
Use the `Python: Attach` configuration in your `launch.json` to attach to the running server. 
Once VS Code picks up the server and starts it, navigate to it's output: 
1. Open command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run the command `MCP: List Servers`
2. Navigate to `local-fabric-rti-mcp` and select `Show Output`
3. Pick up the process id (PID) of the server from the output
4. Run the `Python: Attach` configuration in your `launch.json` file, and paste the PID of the server in the prompt
5. The debugger will attach to the server process, and you can start debugging


## üß™ Test the MCP Server

### Via GitHub Copilot
1. Open GitHub Copilot in VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode)
2. You should see the Fabric RTI MCP Server in the list of tools
3. Try prompts that tell the agent to use the RTI tools, such as:
   - **Eventhouse**: "List my Kusto tables" or "Show me a sample from the StormEvents table"
   - **Eventstreams**: "List all Eventstreams in my workspace" or "Show me details of my data processing Eventstream"
4. The agent should be able use the Fabric RTI MCP Server tools to complete your query

### Via VS Code Client Tool
For direct testing and development, use the included VS Code client:

```bash
# Interactive mode with menu
python eventstream_test/vscode_mcp_client.py

# Natural language commands
python eventstream_test/vscode_mcp_client.py "list eventstreams in workspace abc-123 with interactive auth"
python eventstream_test/vscode_mcp_client.py "query cluster https://example.kusto.windows.net: MyTable | take 10"
python eventstream_test/vscode_mcp_client.py "get fabric api base url"
```

The VS Code client includes:
- üîê **Interactive authentication** - Browser-based Microsoft sign-in
- üó£Ô∏è **Natural language prompts** - English commands for MCP operations  
- ‚öôÔ∏è **API configuration** - Runtime control of Fabric API endpoints
- üìä **JSON output** - Formatted results for analysis

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The Fabric RTI MCP Server is designed with a clean, modular architecture:

### MCP Server Core

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kusto_service.py      # Core Kusto operations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kusto_tools.py        # MCP tool definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kusto_connection.py   # Connection management

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ common.py                 # Shared utilities
```

### Standalone Tools
```
tools/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ eventstream_client/       # Standalone Eventstream tools
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai_agent_openai.py    # AI agent for Eventstream management
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.py             # Configuration management

    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ run_agent.py          # Agent runner
```

### Testing & Client Tools
```
tests/                        # Test scripts and validation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validate_final.py         # Final validation for PR readiness
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_kusto_service.py     # Kusto service unit tests

eventstream_test/             # Test utilities and examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_api_config.py        # Test Fabric API configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_eventstream_client.py # Test Eventstream MCP client
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_mcp_connection.py    # Test MCP server connection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vscode_mcp_client.py      # VS Code MCP client with interactive auth
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vscode-mcp-client.ipynb   # Jupyter notebook examples
```

> **Note**: The `tools/` directory contains standalone utilities that can be used independently of the MCP server for direct Fabric integration and automation. The `eventstream_test/` directory contains testing utilities and client examples.

### Key Design Principles

- üîß **Modular**: Each service (Kusto, Eventstream) is self-contained
- üîÑ **Async/Sync Bridge**: Seamless integration between async operations and MCP's sync interface
- üéØ **Clean Separation**: MCP server code separate from standalone tools
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safe**: Comprehensive type annotations throughout
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Connection caching and efficient resource management


## üîë Authentication

The MCP Server seamlessly integrates with your host operating system's authentication mechanisms, making it super easy to get started! We use Azure Identity under the hood via [`DefaultAzureCredential`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication/credential-chains?tabs=dac), which tries these credentials in order:

1. **Environment Variables** (`EnvironmentCredential`) - Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
1. **Visual Studio** (`VisualStudioCredential`) - Uses your Visual Studio credentials
1. **Azure CLI** (`AzureCliCredential`) - Uses your existing Azure CLI login
1. **Azure PowerShell** (`AzurePowerShellCredential`) - Uses your Az PowerShell login
1. **Azure Developer CLI** (`AzureDeveloperCliCredential`) - Uses your azd login
1. **Interactive Browser** (`InteractiveBrowserCredential`) - Falls back to browser-based login if needed

If you're already logged in through any of these methods, the Fabric RTI MCP Server will automatically use those credentials.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

Your credentials are always handled securely through the official [Azure Identity SDK](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity/README.md) - **we never store or manage tokens directly**.

MCP as a phenomenon is very novel and cutting-edge. As with all new technology standards, consider doing a security review to ensure any systems that integrate with MCP servers follow all regulations and standards your system is expected to adhere to. This includes not only the Azure MCP Server, but any MCP client/agent that you choose to implement down to the model provider.
