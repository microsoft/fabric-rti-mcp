Analysis of EventStream Creation Failures
==========================================

Based on the conversation summary and API examination, here are the key issues:

## Problem Analysis

1. **InvalidDefinitionParts Error**: The Fabric API is rejecting our eventstream definitions 
   with "InvalidDefinitionParts" errors.

2. **API Format Requirements**: The working eventstream shows the API expects THREE parts:
   - `eventstream.json` - The main eventstream definition
   - `eventstreamProperties.json` - Properties like retention and throughput
   - `.platform` - Platform metadata with schema and config

3. **Our Current Implementation**: Only sends TWO parts:
   - `eventstream.json` - Our definition  
   - `.platform` - Same payload as eventstream.json (WRONG!)

## Root Cause

Looking at eventstream_service.py line 160-170, our payload structure is:

```python
"definition": {
    "parts": [
        {
            "path": "eventstream.json",
            "payload": definition_b64,
            "payloadType": "InlineBase64"
        },
        {
            "path": ".platform", 
            "payload": definition_b64,  # <-- WRONG! Should be platform metadata
            "payloadType": "InlineBase64"
        }                
    ]
}
```

## What Should Be Fixed

1. **Missing eventstreamProperties.json**: We need to add the properties file with:
   ```json
   {
     "retentionTimeInDays": 1,
     "eventThroughputLevel": "Low"
   }
   ```

2. **Wrong .platform payload**: Should contain platform metadata, not eventstream definition:
   ```json
   {
     "$schema": "https://developer.microsoft.com/json-schemas/fabric/gitIntegration/platformProperties/2.0.0/schema.json",
     "metadata": {
       "type": "Eventstream",
       "displayName": "EventstreamName",
       "description": "Description"
     },
     "config": {
       "version": "2.0",
       "logicalId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Missing IDs in definition**: The eventstream.json needs proper `id` fields for all components
   (sources, streams, destinations, operators).

## Next Steps

1. Fix the eventstream_service.py to send all three required parts
2. Create proper platform metadata payload
3. Add eventstreamProperties.json with retention/throughput settings
4. Ensure all components in eventstream.json have proper UUIDs
